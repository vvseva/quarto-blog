That was my undergraduate thesis in BA Sociology that i presented at the INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SCIENCE OF SCIENCE AND INNOVATION (ICSSI 2023, Kellogg, Northwestern University)

While the field of Computational Social Science allows modelling with almost unlimited freedom, so it requires explicit transition from **theoretical assumptions** (how individuals behave and what are the consequences) into **computational representations** (data structures, decision-making rules). Moreover, researchers are **embedded in disciplines** (invisible colleges), so they apply **tacit knowledge** in the form of **disciplinary** **conventions**, e.g., **concepts** **and** **references**
