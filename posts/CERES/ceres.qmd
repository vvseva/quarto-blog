I was working as a RA at University of Bergen and created a course recommendation systems, using R Shiny that was integrated with Elasticsearch and doc2vec embedding model.

The interface included a small survey about motivations and priorities of exchange students, a small AB test of recommendation algorithms (tf-idf vs embeddings) and an actual course search system. We presented some initial results at International Conference on Learning Analytics & Knowledge (LAK21).
