If we can agree that there is a need for reproducibility of scientific results, and when we learned that a single study or even an experiment with null hypothesis significance provides limited evidence about the true data generating process. Thus, we need to design studies with reproducibility-first in mind i.e. replicative experiments.

That was my final paper for the course "Explanation and reproducibility in data-driven science" by Jessica Hullman.
