In the summer of 2021, I got an internship at the most heavily loaded social networking service in post-soviet space â€“ [vk.com](https://vk.com/about).

All the research results are summed up in this video below (in Russian). In English, I look at ego networks of a sample from a population scale data, and how the dynamics of communication changed over time. For some NDA reasons we were not able to publish results.
