**Bottom line:** practice is king.

We found that students used the study app in very different ways: some consistently throughout the class, others only to cram before the exam, and some barely or not at all. Those who used the app for self-regulated learning outperformed those who didn’t.

That was the longest road I have taken so far. Five years have passed since I first saw the data, and even longer since it was collected. Conceptually, I have moved from a classical "squeeze the maximum out of the data" mindset to a more transparent post-positivism. The data was still tortured.

The chart utilizes box plots overlaid with jittered raw data points to show the distribution of 193 observations. The Y-axis represents a normalized scale (POMS) from 0.00 to 1.00. The X-axis displays ten variables: Attempts, Successful attempts, Unique days, Consecutive days, Use of compete/battle modes, Early start, Late finish, Maximum time, Mean time, and Minimum time."}

I created my most complicated visualization to show 193 observations across ten continuous and categorical axes. It is messy, but I like my arrows and Epanechnikov’s kernel.
