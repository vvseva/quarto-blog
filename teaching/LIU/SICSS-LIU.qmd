I was part of the Summer 2025 [SICSS-IAS](https://sicss.io/2025/ias/) program at Linköping University that coexisted with Summer School on Methods for Social Scientists. I helped to transition Digital Traces Lab from twitter to Bluesky, and explained the post API world. For the SNA lab i mostly did maintenance and updated examples to tidygraph.
