I use social network analysis models to understand mechanism of interaction and communication in human-AI teams.\n\nBefore that, I worked as a research assistant at [Universitetet i Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/persons/Vsevolod.Suschevskiy). Together with Mohammad Khalil at [SLATE](https://slate.uib.no/), we created CERES – a virtuall lab to study course recommendation system. We even published a [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350874550_Creating_a_Course_Recommendation_System_for_Exchange_Students) about the first iteration, but we also managed to launch and analyze a pilot experiment with real students. Furthermore, I worked on analyzing classroom intervention with mixed models and SEMs. *(one day it will be published)*\n\nAlso, I was a moderate [Computer’ish Science](https://spb.hse.ru/en/ma/computer/) student at HSE University. I worked with Ilya Musabirov, and my thesis reacived a research grant from Toloka to explore the effect of self nudges on motivation.\n\nLast, but not for the amount of time it required, I worked as (1) an invited lecturer at [Data Science minor](https://electives.hse.ru/minor_data_spb/) at the same HSE University. The course was mostly a mix of CSS and intro to data science for 200 non-STEM students, so we are talking about *tidyverse*, *tidymodels*, and *shiny*. In addition, (2) an invited lecturer for a graduate-level course – Into to Small Data Science for Political Science students. And (3) an invited co-lecturer for a Data Visualization course with [Anastasia Kuznetsova](https://t.me/nastengraph) at [European University at St. Petersburg](https://eusp.org/programs/applied-data-analysis). *(At some point, some materials will be available at ...)*\n:::\n\n### Test of visnetwork\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrequire(visNetwork, quietly = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: package 'visNetwork' was built under R version 4.3.3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# minimal example\nnodes <- data.frame(id = 1:3)\nedges <- data.frame(from = c(1,2), to = c(1,3))\nvisNetwork(nodes, edges, width = \"100%\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-22e6e4bf2bd28ee6a7ec\" style=\"width:100%;height:480px;\" class=\"visNetwork html-widget\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-22e6e4bf2bd28ee6a7ec\">{\"x\":{\"nodes\":{\"id\":[1,2,3]},\"edges\":{\"from\":[1,2],\"to\":[1,3]},\"nodesToDataframe\":true,\"edgesToDataframe\":true,\"options\":{\"width\":\"100%\",\"height\":\"100%\",\"nodes\":{\"shape\":\"dot\"},\"manipulation\":{\"enabled\":false}},\"groups\":null,\"width\":\"100%\",\"height\":null,\"idselection\":{\"enabled\":false},\"byselection\":{\"enabled\":false},\"main\":null,\"submain\":null,\"footer\":null,\"background\":\"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n",
