I combine the lenses of analytical sociology and human-computer interaction to understand the mechanisms of computer-supported collaborative work. To do that, I build virtual lab experiments where I can look at digital traces and ask ego-centric questions. Finally, I use social network analysis to untangle the social structure in human-AI teams. I am also passionate about the Open Science movement, especially the idea of integrative experiments. Recently I have worked as a replicator for a massive open collaboration project and participated in the replication Game.\n\n## Bio\n\nIn Summer 2022, I joined [Technology and Social Behaviour](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University where I work as a research assistant at [SONIC](http://sonic.northwestern.edu/). I use social network analysis models to understand mechanism of interaction and communication in human-AI teams. Recently, I have been engaging with open science initiatives, like replication games, and massive collaboration projects.\n\nBefore that, I worked as a research assistant at [Universitetet i Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/persons/Vsevolod.Suschevskiy). Together with Mohammad Khalil at [SLATE](https://slate.uib.no/), we created CERES â€“ a virtuall lab to study course recommendation system. We even published a [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350874550_Creating_a_Course_Recommendation_System_for_Exchange_Students) about the first iteration, but we also managed to launch and analyze a pilot experiment with real students. Furthermore, I worked on analyzing classroom intervention with mixed models and SEMs. *(sumbitted to a* Journal of Internet and Higher Education*)*\n\nAlso, I was a [HCI](https://spb.hse.ru/en/ma/computer/) student at HSE University. I worked with Ilya Musabirov, and my thesis received a research grant from Toloka to explore the effect of self nudges on motivation.\n\nLast, but not by the amount of time it required, I worked as (1) an invited lecturer at [Data Science minor](https://electives.hse.ru/minor_data_spb/) at the same HSE University. The course was mostly a mix of CSS and intro to data science for 200 non-STEM students. We are talking about *tidyverse*, *tidymodels*, and *shiny*. In addition, I worked as (2, 3) an invited lecturer for a graduate-level courses: Small Data Science for Political Science students, and Intro to Experiments for HCI. Finally, (4) an invited co-lecturer for a Data Visualization course with [Anastasia Kuznetsova](https://t.me/nastengraph) at [European University at St. Petersburg](https://eusp.org/programs/applied-data-analysis). *(At some point, some materials will be available [somewhere here](/teaching.html))*\n:::\n\n### Test of visnetwork\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrequire(visNetwork, quietly = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: package 'visNetwork' was built under R version 4.3.3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# minimal example\nnodes <- data.frame(id = 1:9,\nlabel = c(\"Seva\", \"Social Network Analysis\", \"Analytical Sociology\", \"Virtual Labs\",\n\"Deployment\", \"Design of Experiments\", \"ERGMs\", \"DyNAMs\", \"Micro-Macro\"),\nlevel = c(1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3))\nedges <- data.frame(from = c(1,1, 1, 4, 4, 2, 2, 3), to = c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9))\nvisNetwork(nodes, edges, width = \"100%\") |> \nvisEdges(arrows = \"to\") |> \nvisHierarchicalLayout() \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-be560777ec2ccdc4e40d\" style=\"width:100%;height:480px;\" class=\"visNetwork html-widget\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-be560777ec2ccdc4e40d\">{\"x\":{\"nodes\":{\"id\":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],\"label\":[\"Seva\",\"Social Network Analysis\",\"Analytical Sociology\",\"Virtual Labs\",\"Deployment\",\"Design of Experiments\",\"ERGMs\",\"DyNAMs\",\"Micro-Macro\"],\"level\":[1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3]},\"edges\":{\"from\":[1,1,1,4,4,2,2,3],\"to\":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]},\"nodesToDataframe\":true,\"edgesToDataframe\":true,\"options\":{\"width\":\"100%\",\"height\":\"100%\",\"nodes\":{\"shape\":\"dot\"},\"manipulation\":{\"enabled\":false},\"edges\":{\"arrows\":\"to\"},\"layout\":{\"hierarchical\":{\"enabled\":true}}},\"groups\":null,\"width\":\"100%\",\"height\":null,\"idselection\":{\"enabled\":false},\"byselection\":{\"enabled\":false},\"main\":null,\"submain\":null,\"footer\":null,\"background\":\"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n",
