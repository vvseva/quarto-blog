::: {#hero-heading}
I study how to improve human-AI teamwork in teams and organizations. I combine the lenses of analytical sociology and human-computer interaction to understand the mechanisms of computer-supported collaborative work. To do that, I build virtual lab experiments where I can look at digital traces and ask ego-centric questions. Finally, I use social network analysis to untangle the social structure in human-AI teams. I am also passionate about the Open Science movement, especially the idea of integrative experiments. Recently, I have worked as a replicator for a massive open collaboration project and participated in a replication game at Northwestern.

## Bio

In Summer 2022, I joined [Technology and Social Behaviour](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University where I work as a research assistant at [SONIC](http://sonic.northwestern.edu/). I use social network analysis models to understand mechanism of interaction and communication in human-AI teams. Recently, I have been engaging with open science initiatives, like replication games, and massive collaboration projects.

Before that, I worked as a research assistant at [Universitetet i Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/persons/Vsevolod.Suschevskiy). Together with Mohammad Khalil at [SLATE](https://slate.uib.no/), we created CERES â€“ a virtuall lab to study course recommendation system. We even published a [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350874550_Creating_a_Course_Recommendation_System_for_Exchange_Students) about the first iteration, but we also managed to launch and analyze a pilot experiment with real students. Furthermore, I worked on analyzing classroom intervention with mixed models and SEMs. *(sumbitted to a* Journal of Internet and Higher Education*)*

Also, I was a [HCI](https://spb.hse.ru/en/ma/computer/) student at HSE University. I worked with Ilya Musabirov, and my thesis received a research grant from Toloka to explore the effect of self nudges on motivation.

Last, but not by the amount of time it required, I worked as (1) an invited lecturer at [Data Science minor](https://electives.hse.ru/minor_data_spb/) at the same HSE University. The course was mostly a mix of CSS and intro to data science for 200 non-STEM students. We are talking about *tidyverse*, *tidymodels*, and *shiny*. In addition, I worked as (2, 3) an invited lecturer for a graduate-level courses: Small Data Science for Political Science students, and Intro to Experiments for HCI. Finally, (4) an invited co-lecturer for a Data Visualization course with [Anastasia Kuznetsova](https://t.me/nastengraph) at [European University at St. Petersburg](https://eusp.org/programs/applied-data-analysis). *(At some point, some materials will be available [somewhere here](/teaching.html))*

### Test of visnetwork

```{r}
require(visNetwork, quietly = TRUE)
# minimal example
nodes <- data.frame(id = 1:9,
label = c("Seva", "Social Network Analysis", "Analytical Sociology", "Virtual Labs",
"Deployment", "Design of Experiments", "ERGMs", "DyNAMs", "Micro-Macro"),
level = c(1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3))
edges <- data.frame(from = c(1,1, 1, 4, 4, 2, 2, 3), to = c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9))
visNetwork(nodes, edges, width = "100%") |> 
visEdges(arrows = "to") |> 
visHierarchicalLayout()
